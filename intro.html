        <h1>This is my SOS letter.</h1>
        <p id="poem">In a group called Kachow, where madness runs free,<br>
            I’m trapped with wild souls in strange company.<br>
            One girl wields shadows, her heart in despair,<br>
            She gaslights my mind—it's too much to bear.<br>
            
            Her whispers are storms that rattle my peace,<br>
            Each day feels a battle I long to release.<br>
            Yet here I remain, in this swirling abyss,<br>
            Losing my grip with each venomous hiss.<br>
            
            My sanity's slipping, like sand through my hands,<br>
            I’m dancing on edges, obeying her plans.<br>
            Send help, I implore—before I’m undone,<br>
            Before I’m lost where darkness has won.<br>
            
            In Kachow’s crazy maze, I silently scream,<br>
            Caught in a nightmare disguised as a dream.
