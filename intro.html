        <h1>This is my SOS letter.</h1>
        <p>In a group called Kachow, where madness runs free,
            I’m trapped with wild souls in strange company.
            One girl wields shadows, her heart in despair,
            She gaslights my mind—it's too much to bear.
            
            Her whispers are storms that rattle my peace,
            Each day feels a battle I long to release.
            Yet here I remain, in this swirling abyss,
            Losing my grip with each venomous hiss.
            
            My sanity's slipping, like sand through my hands,
            I’m dancing on edges, obeying her plans.
            Send help, I implore—before I’m undone,
            Before I’m lost where darkness has won.
            
            In Kachow’s crazy maze, I silently scream,
            Caught in a nightmare disguised as a dream. (Ö)</p>
